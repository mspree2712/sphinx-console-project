    ColecoVision [#f4]_

The ColecoVision was a second generation console released in 1982. It performed better than the Telstar, selling over
two million units by the time it was discontinued in 1985 when Coleco left the video game market.

The ColecoVision was known for its capability to produce smooth graphics as well as its ability to offer a closer
experience to more powerful arcade games than its competitors in the Atari 2600. Coleco also released a series of
hardware add-ons to expand the capabilities of the console.
