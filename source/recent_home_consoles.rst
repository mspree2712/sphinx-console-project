Recent Home Consoles
====================
Nintendo Wii
------------
Nintendo did not slow down after its early success. They decided to keep
innovating. In 2006, Nintendo introduced the Wii. The Wii was revolutionary
for consoles, as it introduced a handheld motion-controlled that was able to
detect rotation and motion. This was in hope of reaching a broader audience than
consoles previously, such as the casual players and players who may be new to
consoles. This is why the Wii was widely popular as a family console and did
well with children. What the Wii lacked in resolution and definition, they
made up for in unique gameplay and fun. The Wii, along with Nintendo's newest
hand-held line, the DS, Nintendo become one of the biggest players in the gaming
industry.

Wii U
-----
With so much success, Nintendo continued forging on, eventually releasing the Wii U
in November of 2012. They distinguished this console with a GamePad, which was a
controller with a screen in the middle, which allowed for mobile play, within a
distance of the console. This allowed for unique gameplay known as asymmetric
multiplayer, where two people playing the same game, would have a different
objective depending on the screen you were using. The Wii U was not initially
accepted. It was most likely one of Nintendo's biggest blunders. The Wii U
launched as a competitor to the PS4 and Xbox One, both pioneering the community
in graphics and gameplay, with a relatively non-existent game lineup at launch.
Sales gradually grew as the consoles life developed, however, it never reached
the level of impact that its predecessors achieved.

Switch
------
Nintendo got back to the grindstone and decided to do what they do best. Creating
an innovative solution that the world had never seen before. They did just that
with their most recent console, the Nintendo Switch. Releasing in 2017, the Switch
is a hybrid device, that can be docked and used as a home console, or taken on the go
in tablet form, with console-level graphics. For the first time, gamers were able
to take their favorite games on the go, and have it look beautiful. The Switch also
built upon the foundations of the Wii, with two detachable controllers known as
Joy-Cons, which had built-in motion sensors. The Switch outsold previous consoles
like the Wii U, GameCube, and Nintendo 64 within the first two years of its launch.
