Game Boy Family (1989-2003)
===========================
The Nintendo Game Boy changed the way people looked at a portable or hand-held
gaming device(s). The only company to attempt prior, was the Milton Bradley
Company with the Microvision, the first handheld game console. This did not
take off, however as it had a small screen and a lack of content support.
In comes the Game Boy, released on April 21, 1989. Pushing it to the top, and
ultimately setting a precedent for hand-held gaming, was the game Tetris. At
the time, Tetris was widely popular, and the move to put it on the Game Boy may
just be one of the smartest moves Nintendo could make. Nintendo would go on to
create the Game Boy Pocket, which was redesigned Game Boy, as well as the Game
Boy Light, which was a variant released only in Japan.

The next major move, however wouldn't happen until the release of the Game Boy
Color. Released on October 21, 1998, added a color screen to the already
popular Game Boy. A major not to the Game Boy color was the added backwards
compatibility, which would allow the playability of older Game Boy cartridges.
This would later become a major feature of the Game Boy line.

Then came the final major upgrade, the Game Boy Advance. This console featured
a larger, higher resolution screen, and the addition of the L and R buttons.
This system was also known for being more powerful than its predecessors. The
lone criticism of this device, was that the screen was not backlit, meaning it
would often be difficult to view content.

Then comes the Game Boy Advance SP, released on February 14, 2003, which
largely resolved some of the Game Boy Advance's problems. This included a
switchable internal front light and a rechargeable battery. This console plays a
special role in my heart, as it was the first console I received when I was
5-years-old (at least until my brothers flushed it down the toilet). This was
the final Game Boy to be developed with backwards compatibility and ushered
in the new age of hand-held consoles.
