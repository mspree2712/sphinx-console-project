    Magnavox Odyssey [#f1]_

The Odyssey was the first commercial home video game console. Its release in September 1972 started the first generation
of home video game consoles and marked the rise of the commercial video game industry.

The Odyssey does not have any sound capabilities. It can display three square monochrome dots and a single line on the
screen, which can be controlled with the button and knobs on the controller according to the rules of the game played.
The console came with plastic overlays to place over the screen to create more interesting visuals with the three dots.
It also came packaged with various boardgame pieces used with these games, such as dice and game cards.

One of the 28 games released for the Odyssey was a ping pong game, which inspired Pong. The console sold approximately
350,000 units by the time it was discontinued in 1975.
