Early Home Consoles
===================
Nintendo Entertainment System
-----------------------------
Nintendo had a huge part in sparking the home console gaming market with the
Nintendo Entertainment System, better known as the NES. The NES was released
in 1983, shortly after what is known as the video game crash of 1983, which
was a large-scale recession in the industry due to an excess of consoles and
games. Many companies in the United States doubted that video games and the
industry as a whole last much longer, and attention shifted towards personal
computers. Meanwhile, Japan was busy switching their focus from arcade-style
games to home consoles. Nintendo took full advantage of that and released what
was first known as the Nintendo Famicom, short for "Family Computer" which is
known by the U.S. as the NES. This console did remarkably well and served to
give a jumpstart to the industry and dominated the market for a time. Many of
Nintendo's most iconic franchises, such as The Legend of Zelda and Metroid,
found their start on the NES.

Super Nintendo Entertainment System
-----------------------------------
7 years past the creation of the NES and Nintendo does it again. In November 1990,
Nintendo released the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, which most refer to as
SNES or Super Nintendo. The SNES was a bit late to the 16-bit era, however, it
found global success, even in the larger parts of Asia, where the NES had struggled.
As with the NES, the Super Nintendo had its claim to fame with beginning entries
into iconic franchises like Star Fox and Mega Man, while continuing lines its
predecessor had started before.

Nintendo 64 and GameCube
------------------------
Some other notable entries and ones most of our generation may start to recognize
were the Nintendo 64, commonly called the N64, and the Nintendo GameCube. The N64
was Nintendo's entry into the 64-bit world, and it pays homage to that in its
name. It was released in 1996 and was the last home console to use a cartridge
as its primary storage format until the most recent Nintendo Switch. It was named
the ninth-greatest video game console of all time by IGN in 2015. And then we
have the GameCube. Released in 2001, the Gamecube took its name after the shape
of the console itself, which happened to be a cube. It was Nintendo's first console
to use optical discs in place of game cartridges. The GameCube also has a special
place in my heart, as it was the first Nintendo home console I ever received for
my third-grade birthday party, however old I was then.
