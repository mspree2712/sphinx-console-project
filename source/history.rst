Company History
===============
Nintendo has become a household term and one of the biggest video game companies
in the world. Founded on September 23, 1889, by Fusajiro Yamauchi, Nintendo began
as playing card company that manufactured and marketed hanafuda cards, translated
as "flower cards" which are Japanese playing cards used in a variety of games.
Based in Kyoto, Japan, the company was initially called Yamauchi Nintendo & Co. Ltd.,
which eventually changed to Nintendo Playing Card Co. Ltd. in 1951. After visiting
the largest United States playing card company, grandson Hiroshi Yamauchi found out
that there was limited potential in playing cards, and in 1963 changed the companies
name to Nintendo Co., Ltd. and began researching various areas of business.

They experimented in the taxi, hotel, television and food industries, however, none were
ultimately successful. After the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Nintendo's stock took a turn
for the worse as playing card sales dropped. That was when they moved into the
Japanese toy industry in 1966, where they had some success, however in 1973 they
shifted their mindset to family entertainment, landing them in the newly emerging
arcade business.

This is where Nintendo truly began to sink their teeth into the video game industry.
They began by becoming a distributor of the Magnavox Odyssey, which eventually led
them to develop their own hardware. The rest, as they say, is history.
